The specialism choice doesn't lock in here (Associate is broader) — but consider what you'll choose at Practitioner tier. UK CONTEXT: UKCSC is a Royal Charter body — ACSP is the only fully UK-sovereign cyber registration available. The UK Government is gradually mapping UKCSC titles to the Government Cyber Security Career Framework, NCSC Assured roles, and CNI sector requirements. CIISec membership (the route here) also opens UK-specific opportunities: regional chapter events (London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh), CIISec Skills Framework alignment for UK CV branding, eligibility to apply for CIISec mentoring scheme. Application fee is GBP — no FX risk. Consider claiming CIISec membership + £362.40 ACSP fee as a professional subscription via HMRC (if employer doesn't reimburse). (UK CIISec chapters: London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh). Worth attending one event before applying — it's where you may meet a referee or the ChCSP holder you eventually need at Phase 6."

Old blueprint ended 2 Feb 2026; new blueprint effective through at least August 2026 (further revision possible after). Key 2026 changes: deeper AI/ML-in-networking objectives, expanded automation (Ansible + Terraform + IaC), expanded spanning-tree coverage, enhanced security fundamentals incl. WPA3, and TROUBLESHOOTING TOPICS MOVED UP TO CCNP (CCNA is now purely foundational).

(2) Network access 20% — VLANs, trunking, EtherChannel, STP, RSTP, wireless architectures, wireless security (WPA2/3, 802.1X). (3) IP connectivity 25% — routing concepts, static routing, OSPFv2 single-area (note: EIGRP removed in v1.1, OSPF only now), first-hop redundancy (HSRP). (4) IP services 10% — NAT, NTP, DNS, DHCP, SNMP, Syslog, SSH, QoS. (5) Security fundamentals 15% — device security (passwords, port security, DHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection), ACLs (standard + extended). (6) Automation and programmability 10% — REST APIs, JSON parsing, Ansible/Terraform/Chef/Puppet awareness, SDN concepts, Infrastructure as Code (new v1.1 focus), AI in networking basics.

    coverage: "Terraform Associate 004 (current exam — 003 retired 8 Jan 2026). Tests Terraform 1.12. Nine objectives: (1) Understand Infrastructure as Code concepts — IaC benefits, declarative vs imperative, Terraform's place vs Ansible/Chef/Puppet/CloudFormation. (2) Understand Terraform's purpose — beyond hyperscaling, use cases. (3) Understand Terraform fundamentals — providers, state concept, providers registry. (4) Use the Terraform CLI outside the core workflow — terraform fmt, validate, taint, workspace, state commands (mv, rm, list, show, pull, push, replace-provider), import, refresh, graph. (5) Interact with Terraform modules — registry, module sources (local, git, terraform registry), versioning constraints, inputs/outputs, publishing. (6) Use the core Terraform workflow — init, plan, apply, destroy, lifecycle (create_before_destroy, prevent_destroy, ignore_changes). (7) Implement and maintain state — local vs remote backends (S3, Azure Storage, Terraform Cloud/HCP), state locking, sensitive data in state (state files store ALL values in plain text including secrets), workspaces. (8) Read, generate, and modify configuration — HCL syntax, variables (types, validation, sensitive), outputs, locals, data sources, built-in functions, dynamic blocks, count/for_each, conditional expressions. (9) Understand HCP Terraform capabilities — workspaces (CLI vs VCS vs API-driven), Sentinel policy-as-code, private module registry, run triggers, cost estimation. Depth: fundamentals + applied. ~70% recognition, 30% applied syntax. Exam tests exact command syntax and flag behaviour heavily. Sample questions are unusually broad-spectrum: multiple-choice, multi-response, true/false, fill-in-blank, text match.",

      note: "✓ Verified against Security Institute documentation (May 2026). CSyP is UK chartered security professional status — UK-sovereign credential, awarded by Worshipful Company of Security Professionals via Security Institute. Different from UKCSC ChCSP (cyber-specific) — CSyP recognises cross-discipline including physical security. For Track B (Physical Security) trajectory CSyP is arguably more valuable than ChCSP. Best-case stack: PSP (ASIS global) + ChCSP (UKCSC cyber chartered) + CSyP (Security Institute cross-discipline chartered) = strongest possible UK senior security professional signal across cyber-physical convergence."

(2) Information Security Risk Management 20% — risk identification, risk assessment (qualitative vs quantitative, ALE/ARO/SLE), risk treatment options (accept, transfer, mitigate, avoid), residual risk, risk monitoring, third-party risk. (3) Information Security Program 33% — THE LARGEST DOMAIN. Program design and management, resource management, information security architecture, controls integration, training and awareness, metrics (KPIs and KRIs), vendor management, compliance monitoring. (4) Incident Management 30% — incident response planning, BCP/DR, incident classification and triage, forensics, lessons learned, crisis communication. Depth: MANAGEMENT-LEVEL, not technical. Every question tests strategic/managerial thinking. The 'BEST' and 'FIRST' distinction in answer choices is critical — CISM wants the risk-averse, business-aligned answer, never the technically-coolest answer.

(2) Application of Physical Security 37% — security design principles (CPTED — Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, defence in depth, deterrence/detection/delay/response), perimeter security, structural and architectural elements, glazing and openings, locks and key control, lighting, access control system design (ID systems, biometrics, multi-factor), CCTV/video surveillance design, intrusion detection design, security force operations. (3) Implementation of Physical Security Measures 26% — project management for physical security, procurement and contract management, integration of physical and electronic systems, system testing and commissioning, transition to operations, maintenance and support.

(3) Endpoint, Network, and Cloud Attack Vectors — common attack patterns, exploitation techniques, post-exploitation, persistence mechanisms. (4) Web Application Attacks — OWASP Top 10 from defender's perspective. (5) Lateral Movement and Cloud Attacks — pivoting, AD attacks, cloud-specific attack chains. (6) Active Defense — counter-reconnaissance, deception, threat hunting.
